# Personal Finance Manager

A MERN stack web application.

# What I Learned
* Gained a much better understanding of the MongoDB | Express | ReactJS | Nodejs technologies.
* Learned various HTTP requests such as GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT. 
* Utilized the Axios library, which made the communication between the client and server sides.
* Worked with React hooks such as useState and useEffect.
* Used the Bootstrap CSS library to enhance the user interface.
* Also was working with ChartJS, a library for data visualization.
 
 Overall, this experience has deepened my knowledge and skills in the MERN stack and front-end development practices. 
 I am now more confident in creating web applications that use MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and Node.js.
 Also equipped with the ability to handle different types of HTTP requests and incorporate libraries like Axios, Bootstrap, and ChartJS.
